Example projects for practice purposes

## Exploratory Data Analysis using R 
Objective - Manage to create various types of data visualizations that include charts and graphs to answer questions regarding a selected dataset.

Example questions include but are not limited to:

1) How does variable A affect variable B?
2) What's the most predictor of variable A?
3) Questions regarding different visualizations
4) etc..

## Multiple Linear Regression Model using R
Objective - Create and test the performance of multiple linear regression to answer questions regarding a selected dataset. 

Example questions include but are not limited to:

1) What's the most influential predictors?
2) Questions regarding the statistics of the model.
3) Actual prediction using make-up data.
4) etc..

## Compare the effects of Randome forest and KNN Classification on Sleep Data Set
Objective - Build and compare the performance (based on accuracy) of a KNN classification model and a random forest based on "Sleep health and lifestyle" data set.

Example questions:
1) Which model performs better, KNN or random forest?
2) What are the possible advantages of using KNN classification, or random forest?
3) etc..

## Web Scraping NBA Statistics using Python
Objective - Build new useable web scraping pipline using Request and Beautifulsoup libraries in Python that generates csv files with data scrap off the NBA Statistics website.

This project also comes with a machine learning notebook that performed regression analysis in predicting the SRS statistic for the team statistic.
